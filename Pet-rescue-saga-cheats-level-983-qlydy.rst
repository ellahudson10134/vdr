Pet Rescue Level Tips. To beat the level we’ve compiled a small list of general tips that should help you along the way. While some tips are more useful than others, it’s always good to be reminded of the basics. #1 Our most important tip would be to take your time because there is no time limit. Taking your time will allow you to roughly calculate where blocks will end up after Estimated Reading Time: 3 mins. Tips for Level The main thing to work on in this Level is to create one column of solid color (it doesn't matter which one, but closer to the Pet is easier) Then click and it will slide your Pet to the left and off the shelf. Make sure your Pet is at the bottom of their column That there is no mesh in the column the Pet is in, or the one you're removing.  · Pet Rescue Saga Level played by  Rescue Saga Walkthrough Playlist:  Rescue Saga Facebook: http://apps.
